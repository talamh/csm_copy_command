# csm_copy_command
CSM for minetest to copy output of commands. Optionally log command output to STDIO.

Use the command .copycmd to turn on/off the CSM, default is off.

Command outputs will then be shown in a formspec where you can hopefully copy them
to clipboard or log them to STDIO. I find copy/paste a bit hit and miss in minetest.

Ignores incoming messages, PM's and a few other things that may be sent/recieved  to/from the chat.
